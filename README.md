# Bumble Web App

The Bumble Web App is a real-time, interactive platform that allows users to connect based on mutual interests. Users can create and update profiles, like or reject other users, and chat in real-time once they've matched. This app is built with Elixir and Phoenix LiveView to offer a dynamic user experience, especially for profile customization and interest selection.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system.
- **Profile Management**: Users can edit their profile information, including name, gender, description, profile photo, and interests.
- **Interest Selection**: Users can choose multiple interests from a list of chips to personalize their profile.
- **Matching and Chat**: If two users mutually like each other, they can start a real-time conversation.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Phoenix LiveView keeps user interactions responsive and up-to-date without page reloads.
- **Location-based Distance Calculation**: Each profile shows the distance from your location.
